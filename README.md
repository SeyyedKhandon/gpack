# Visual Studio Code Git Extension Pack (GPack)

### GPack

Git Essentials Extension Pack for Visual Studio Code (GPack)

> These are some of my favorite git extensions which makes `VSCode` git management like `WebStorm`.

**Notes**:

- You can use `Local History` instead of `Checkpoints`, it has a closer experience to `Webstorm` `Local History`, but it can be annoying because will create anywhere a `.history` folder.
  - [Local History](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xyz.local-history) - Save files into local history like `Webstorm` localhistory, to have a checkpoints on each save change which you are working.
